ASCII Roguelike

************DESCRIPTION************
In this project I will be attempting to create a simple ASCII Roguelike game. A roguelike game generally "a subgenre of role-playing video games characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedureally generated game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and permanent death of the player-character," (Wikipedia, Roguelike, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike). While my game will attempt to incorporate as many of these characteristics as possible, it will likely be missing several key attributes. The game will probably be focused on an objective rather than role-playing for the sake of coding, but will include other elements like a dungeon crawl, permanent death, and simple graphics. I will be using levels based purely on ASCII text to create walls, objects, and enemies. The code should include classes for the following objects: The Game System, Each Level, Enemies/Monsters, Playable Character. Several structs will likely be used out of necessity, but a Linked List is intended to be used as a way of storing an inventory.
